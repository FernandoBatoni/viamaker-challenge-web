```batch
bun install | yarn install

## ðŸ§ž Commands

To execute command terminals, I highly suggest using Bun, however it requires WSL or Linux, so if you don't want to install a Linux subsystem, use Yarn instead.
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command               | Action                                           |
| :---------------------| :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`         | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:300`      |
| `bun build`           | Build your production site to `./build/`          |
| `bun preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
